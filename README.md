## Tests

```shell
$ cargo test --workspace
```

This run both unit and integration tests; if some tests randomly fail, please ensure you have some free space left in
`/tmp`.

If you have Nix, you can use `nix-build .` as a shorthand to ensure everything's alright, as it's automatically running
all the tests too.

## Formatting

```shell
$ cargo fmt
```
